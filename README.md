1. Develop a Python-based Lambda function by employing the Boto3 module. _Boto3 module helps to interact with AWS APIs_
2. Now, check for all the permissions required which are NOT applied by default.
3. Now that all the work has been done, just CLOUDWATCH is to be integrated to trigger an event.

Viola! You have now automated the Cloud Cost Optimisation process! Congratulations!!!
