1. Develop a Python-based Lambda function by employing the Boto3 module. (Boto3 module helps to interact with AWS APIs)
2. Now, check for all the permissions required which are NOT applied by default.
3. Now, all the work has been done, just CLOUDWATCH is to be integrated for the purpose of triggering an event.

Viola! You have now automated the Cloud Cost Optimisation process! Congratulations!!!
